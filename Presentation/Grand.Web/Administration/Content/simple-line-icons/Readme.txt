To modify your generated font, use the *dev.svg* file, located in the *fonts* folder in 
this package. You can import this dev.svg file to the IcoMoon app. All the tags (class 
names) and the Unicode points of your glyphs are saved in this file.

These fonts converted to SVG using Illustrator, the SVG was then converted into a font 
using the awesome Icooon app (http://icomoon.io/app)
