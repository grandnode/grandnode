This repository contains a legacy version of GrandNode. 

Urgent info: We do not currently maintain the legacy version — we provide limited support for bug fixing until the end of 2022 only. All our resources are focused on GrandNode v2 development. 

GrandNode v2 is our own open-source e-commerce platform based on .NET Core 5.0 and MongoDB. Written from the scratch. 

New updates and improvements will not be available on the legacy version. For updates please look at the GrandNode v2 repository - https://github.com/grandnode/grandnode2.
