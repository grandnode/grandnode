![Technology Stack](https://grandnode.com/content/images/uploaded/Blog/technologystack1.JPG)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

GrandNode requires .NET Core 3.1, MongoDB 4.0+, and OS-specific dependency tools. 

### Installation

GrandNode can be installed in a few different ways. Note: The develop branch is the development version of GrandNode and it may be unstable. To use the
latest stable version, download it from the Releases page or switch to a release branch. 

* Docker 
```
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo 
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name grandnode --link mongodb:mongo grandnode/develop
``` 
If you want to download the latest stable version of GrandNode please use the following command, where x.xx is a number of GrandNode release: 
```
docker pull grandnode/grandnode:x.xx 
```

* Open locally with VS2019+

Run the project in the Visual Studio 2019+, extract the source code package downloaded from Releases tab to a folder. Enter the extracted folder and double-click the GrandNode.sln solution file. Select the Plugins project, rebuild it, then select the GrandNode.Web project.

* Host on Linux server 

Before you start - please install, configure the nginx server, .NET Core 3.1+ and MongoDB 4.0+
```
mkdir ~/source
cd ~/source
git clone - b x.xx https://github.com/grandnode/grandnode.git
```
```
cd ~/source/grandnode
dotnet restore GrandNode.sln
```
Now it's time to rebuild all of our plugins and publish application (command is pretty long because we've combined all commands in a single line, to ease up your work):
```
sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.DiscountRequirements.Standard && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.ExchangeRate.McExchange && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.ExternalAuth.Facebook && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.Payments.CashOnDelivery && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.Payments.BrainTree && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.ExternalAuth.Google && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.Payments.PayPalStandard && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.Shipping.ByWeight && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.Shipping.FixedRateShipping && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.Shipping.ShippingPoint && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.Tax.CountryStateZip && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.Tax.FixedRate && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.Widgets.FacebookPixel && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.Widgets.GoogleAnalytics && sudo dotnet build Plugins/Grand.Plugin.Widgets.Slider && sudo dotnet publish Grand.Web -c Release -o /var/webapps/grandnode
```
Optional: Create the service file, to automatically restart your application.
```
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/grandnode.service
```
Paste the following content, and save changes:
```
[Unit]
Description=GrandNode

WorkingDirectory=/var/webapps/grandnode
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dotnet /var/webapps/grandnode/Grand.Web.dll
