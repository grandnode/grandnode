Microsoft.Web.Redis.RedisSessionStateProvider Nuget package has been added to your project.

A new <sessionstate> entry has been added to your web.config. However, any existing session state entries will not have been modified. 
If you believe you had an existing sessionstate entry, you will need to manually modify the web.config to make the Redis Session State Provider as the default.

## Version 2.0.0
 * This release contains a breaking change from '1.*' versions in the format of key names used to store session data.  In order to support Redis Clusters, key names now include brackets. As a result of this change, existing session data will not be recognized by this session state provider.
